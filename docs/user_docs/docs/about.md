<h4>A brief history & acknowledgment</h4>
</div>

!!! Note "Sunrise Productions"
    We would like to acknowledge [Sunrise Productions](https://sunriseproductions.tv/) for providing us a studio incubator for 2019 and 2020. 
    Sunrise kept food on the table and believed in nxt before it was fully realized. Without their support we would never have made it this far.

!!! Note "SVAD Productions"
    We would like to acknowledge the [School of Visual Art and Design](https://www.southern.edu/visualartanddesign/) NXT began in 2017 as a research project at SVAD. 
    Originally with the goal to make it the core rigging framework, nxt quickly grew into the backbone of pipeline.
    We are grateful for SVAD providing the resources, education, and sponsorship to get us started.

<h1>The open nxt project</h1>
</div>

In simple terms, we want nxt to be too good to hide. If we can deliver on the potential we, the contributors, know is contained in nxt, we can provide great wins across 
many parts of the computer graphics pipeline. The full realization of nxt can only come at the scale of a public release.

Some of the most important technologies in our industry are open source, including [unreal engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/), 
[python](https://www.python.org/), [qt](https://www.qt.io/), [centos](https://wiki.centos.org/FrontPage), 
and the newest and perhaps biggest upcoming technology in the industry [pixar usd](http://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html). 
What all these tools have in common (excepting the newcomer usd) is how ubiquitous and wide reaching they are. Open source tools invite developers to bend them, tweak them, 
and customize them to fit the exact needs of their users. The entertainment industry is full of amazing developers who are excited to build great things. 
We believe nxt will become a stronger and better tool because it is open source.

We invite and will seek out opportunities to refine and hone this vision with the help and partnership of everyone who wants nxt to be great.
